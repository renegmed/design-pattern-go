Title: Proxy in Go
URL: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/proxy/go/example#example-0

Proxy is a structural design pattern that provides an object that 
acts as a substitute for a real service object used by a client. 

A proxy receives client requests, does some work (access control, 
caching, etc.) and then passes the request to a service object.

Conceptual Example
------------------

A web server such as Nginx can act as a proxy for your application server:

    It provides controlled access to your application server.

    It can do rate limiting.

    It can do request caching.
