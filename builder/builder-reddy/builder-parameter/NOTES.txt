Builder Parameters

What?

Builder parameters help us to restrict usage of struct properties and functions directly.

Why?

Sometimes we want to restrict users from accessing the properties and functions of a 
struct directly. We provide them with our APIs instead.

Imagine, we have to create a new feature which can send emails, and you don’t want your 
developers to start messing with your email object. You hide it with Builder parameters.

You'll notice in the code that we don’t have access to the email struct nor the actual function 
that sends an email.

The user can use this API without bothering about the implementation and validation 
logic to create a complex object.
