The builder pattern is a creational design pattern. It is used when the creation of a product involves multiple, independent steps.

What's the one thing that immediately comes to your mind when you think of something that requires multiple steps to be "built"? That's right, subway!! 
You choose your bread, you choose if you want cheese, you choose your toppings and finally your sauces!

I'm sure you understand the process of creating a sub. Let's see what it would look like if we coded it using the Builder pattern:
Subway Example

Let us assume that we have 2 different types(recipes) for a sub - Veggie Delight and Chicken Teriyaki. Each of these would have a "Builder" dedicated to them.

The interface that these builders implement will be the same - That way, we can easily add more types(recipes) to our menu.
