Intent

Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and 
restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details 
of its implementation.


Problem

Imagine that youâ€™re creating a text editor app. In addition to simple text 
editing, your editor can format text, insert inline images, etc.

At some point, you decided to let users undo any operations carried out 
on the text. This feature has become so common over the years that 
nowadays people expect every app to have it. For the implementation, 
you chose to take the direct approach. Before performing any operation, 
the app records the state of all objects and saves it in some storage. 

Later, when a user decides to revert an action, the app fetches the latest snapshot from the history and uses it to restore the state of all objects.
