Title: Golang Bridge Pattern 
URL: https://www.sourcecodeexamples.net/2021/06/golang-bridge-pattern.html

Bridge decouples the implementation from the abstraction. The abstract base class 
can be subclassed to provide different implementations and allow implementation 
details to be modified easily. 

The interface, which is a bridge, helps in making the functionality of concrete 
classes independent from the interface implementer classes. 

The bridge patterns allow the implementation details to change at runtime.

Golang Bridge Pattern Implementation
------------------------------------

Let's say IDrawShape is an interface with the drawShape() method. DrawShape implements 
the IDrawShape interface. 

We create an IContour bridge interface with the drawContour() method. The Contour class 
implements the IContour interface.
