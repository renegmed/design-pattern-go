Title: 6. Template method pattern
URL: https://programmerall.com/article/3965356491/

Define the skeleton of an algorithm in operation and 
delay some steps to subclasses. 

The template method allows subclasses to redefine certain 
specific steps of an algorithm without changing the 
structure of the algorithm.

NOTE:

Since Go can't define abstract methods in the parent class 
like Java, and then implement them in the subclass, in order 
to achieve the actual effect is to call the subclass method 
in the parent class method. 

Here we use the method passed in func to achieve abstraction method.

Animals haveEat()withSleep()Methods, for different animals, the 
effects of Eat and Sleep methods are different. 

But itâ€™s roughly the same, each animal is just slightly different, 
then we can use the template method pattern to abstract animal realization

To leave specific animals one by oneEmpty method, Wait for specific 
animals to realize theEmpty method.
