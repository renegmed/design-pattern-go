Title: Elegant way to implement template method pattern in Golang
URL: https://newbedev.com/elegant-way-to-implement-template-method-pattern-in-golang


The essence of the template method pattern is it allows you to inject in 
an implementation of a particular function or functions into the skeleton 
of an algorithm.

You can achieve this in Go by injecting in a function or an interface into 
your Runner. To achieve the basic template method pattern you don't really 
need your Logger struct at all
