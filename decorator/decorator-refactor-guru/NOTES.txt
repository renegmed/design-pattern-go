Title: Decorator in Go
URL: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator/go/example#example-0



Decorator is a structural pattern that allows adding new behaviors to objects 
dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects.

Using decorators you can wrap objects countless number of times since both 
target objects and decorators follow the same interface. The resulting object 
will get a stacking behavior of all wrappers.
