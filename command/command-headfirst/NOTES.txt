A command object encapsulates a request to do something (like turn on a light) on a 
specific object (say, the living room light object). 

So, if we store a command object for each button, when the button is pressed we ask 
the command object to do some work.


Wiki Definition: 

The Command Pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterise 
other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
