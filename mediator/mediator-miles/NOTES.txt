Title: The Mediator Pattern In Go
URL: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-mediator-pattern-in-go-344ee5c8c2f4

TMediator pattern is here to help when you have a collection of entities that 
cannot or should not communicate with each other directly. 

It allows you to have a central point of information flow so that your other 
objects or methods can focus on their own business logic. 

When used proactively, the Mediator pattern prevents tight coupling, separates 
responsibilities and gives your code a flexible foundation to expand upon.
