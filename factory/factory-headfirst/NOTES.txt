Wiki Definition: 

The Factory Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which 
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.


BIG PICTURE

    The Factory Pattern separates product construction code from the code that actually uses the product. 
    Therefore it’s easier to extend the product construction code independently from the rest of the code. 
    Example, to franchise the PizzaStore to new areas, we need to just create a new creator subclass and 
    override the factory method (createPizza) in that.
    
    Use the Factory Method when you want to reuse the existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time.


With the Factory Pattern, we have created a framework that lets the subclasses decide which implementation 
of CreatePizza() will be used.
