Title: Golang Facade Pattern 
URL: https://www.sourcecodeexamples.net/2021/06/golang-facade-pattern.html

The Facade pattern is used to abstract subsystem interfaces with a helper. The 
facade design pattern is used in scenarios when the number of interfaces increases 
and the system gets complicated.

The Facade is an entry point to different subsystems, and it simplifies the dependencies 
between the systems. The facade pattern provides an interface that hides the implementation 
details of the hidden code.

A loosely coupled principle can be realized with a facade pattern. You can use a facade 
to improve poorly designed APIs. In SOA, a service facade can be used to incorporate 
changes to the contract and implementation.

Golang Facade Pattern Implementation
------------------------------------

For example, account, customer, and transaction are the classes that have account, 
customer, and transaction creation methods. BranchManagerFacade can be used by the client to create an account, customer, and transaction.
