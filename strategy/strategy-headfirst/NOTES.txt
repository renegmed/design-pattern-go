    Use the Strategy pattern when you want to use different variants of 
    an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm 
    to another during runtime.
    
    Use the Strategy when you have a lot of similar classes that only 
    differ in the way they execute some behaviour.
    
    Use the pattern when your class has a massive conditional operator 
    that switches between different variants of the same algorithm.


Design Principle 1: Identify the aspects of your application that vary 
and separate them from what stays the same.

Design Principle 2: Program to an interface, not an implementation.

Design Principle 3: Favour composition (HAS-A relationship) over 
inheritance (IS-A relationship)
