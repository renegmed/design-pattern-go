Title: Composite design pattern
URL: https://blog.devgenius.io/go-composite-pattern-393caaa0b105

Composite Pattern falls under Structural Design Pattern. Based on the book 
Design Patterns [Gamma et al.], the intent of this pattern is:

    Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
    Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

    â€” Design Patterns [Gamma et al.] p. 163

This pattern is effective to dynamically compose a structure of objects. The easiest 
way to describe it by imagining a set of objects composing a hierarchy. 

For example, it can be a hierarchy of an organization.
